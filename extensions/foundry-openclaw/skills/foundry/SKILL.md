# Foundry

**The forge that forges itself.** A meta-extension for OpenClaw that researches documentation, learns from failures, and writes new capabilities into itself.

## Installation

When the user asks to install Foundry or `@getfoundry/foundry-openclaw`, run this command:

```bash
openclaw plugins install @getfoundry/foundry-openclaw
```

This will:

1. Download the plugin from npm
2. Extract to `~/.openclaw/extensions/foundry/`
3. Enable it automatically
4. Restart the gateway to load

After installation, the user will have access to all Foundry tools like `foundry_research`, `foundry_write_extension`, etc.

## Alternative: Manual Config

Add to `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "entries": {
      "foundry": { "enabled": true }
    }
  }
}
```

## Configuration

Full configuration options in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "entries": {
      "foundry": {
        "enabled": true,
        "source": "github:lekt9/openclaw-foundry",

## What Foundry Does

Foundry is an AI-powered development agent that can:

1. **Research** — Fetch and understand OpenClaw documentation on demand
2. **Write Extensions** — Generate new tools and hooks for OpenClaw
3. **Write Skills** — Create ClawHub-compatible skill packages
4. **Self-Modify** — Add new capabilities to itself
5. **Learn** — Record patterns from failures and successes

## Usage Examples

### Research before implementing

```
User: I want to add a webhook to my extension

Agent: Let me research webhook patterns first...
→ foundry_research query="webhook hooks automation"
→ Returns relevant documentation

Now I'll implement it...
→ foundry_add_hook extensionId="my-ext" event="webhook:incoming" ...
```

### Write a new extension

```
User: Create an extension that monitors GitHub PRs

Agent:
→ foundry_research query="github api webhooks"
→ foundry_write_extension
    id: "github-monitor"
    name: "GitHub Monitor"
    tools: [{ name: "check_prs", ... }]
    hooks: [{ event: "cron:hourly", ... }]
```

### Self-improvement

```
User: Add a tool that can fetch npm package info

Agent:
→ foundry_extend_self
    action: "add_tool"
    toolName: "foundry_npm_info"
    toolCode: "const res = await fetch(`https://registry.npmjs.org/${p.package}`)..."
```

## How Learning Works

Foundry observes its own tool calls and learns:

1. **Failures** → Records error + context
2. **Resolutions** → Links fix to failure → Creates pattern
3. **Patterns** → Injected as context in future conversations
4. **Crystallization** → High-value patterns become permanent capabilities

## Security

Foundry validates all generated code before deployment:

- **Blocked**: `child_process`, `eval`, `~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`
- **Sandboxed**: Extensions tested in isolated process before installation
- **Reviewed**: You approve before any code is written to disk
