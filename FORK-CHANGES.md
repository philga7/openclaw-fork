# Fork-specific changes

Explicit listing of changes in this fork relative to upstream [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw). For sync procedure, see [.agent/workflows/update_clawdbot.md](.agent/workflows/update_clawdbot.md).

## ClawdBot-Next / prompt-engine integration

- **Agent system prompt** — Integrated [ClawdBot-Next](https://github.com/ClawdBot/ClawdBot-Next) prompt-engine:
  - `src/agents/prompt-engine/`: skills loader, triangulator, skill injector, system directives, types, clawd-matrix, data/skills.json, data/domain-map.json.
  - `src/agents/system-prompt.ts`: uses `SkillsLoader`, `Triangulator`, `SkillInjector`, `SYSTEM_DIRECTIVES`; `buildAgentSystemPrompt` is async and accepts optional `userPrompt` for triangulation. Skill selection is driven by `SkillsLoader.getSkillsForDomain(context.domain)` using domain-map.json (no hardcoded domain→skill mapping). OpenClaw-specific sections (safety, branding, `memoryCitationsMode`, sandbox) preserved.
  - `src/agents/pi-embedded-runner/system-prompt.ts`: passes `userPrompt` through to `buildAgentSystemPrompt` and awaits it.
- **Domain-map and JSON-driven routing** — Domain detection and skill selection are config-driven:
  - `data/domain-map.json`: defines per-domain `triggers` (keywords for rule-based routing) and `skills` (skill names to load), plus optional `global_defaults` applied to every domain. Same resolution order as skills.json (dist/data, then source).
  - Triangulator builds regex rules from `SkillsLoader.getDomainTriggers()` instead of hardcoded KEYWORD_RULES; adds a General fallback rule for greetings.
  - SkillsLoader exposes `loadDomainMap()`, `getDomainTriggers()`, and `getSkillsForDomain(domain)`; skill selection in the system prompt uses `getSkillsForDomain` exclusively.
- Kept in sync with upstream ClawdBot-Next where applicable; OpenClaw naming and config preserved where we diverge.

## Maintainer-specific changes

### Documentation and maintenance

- **Docs + metadata**
  - Root [README.md](README.md): “About this repository” section describing the fork, ClawdBot-Next integration, [docs/MAINTENANCE.md](docs/MAINTENANCE.md) link, and sync workflow link.
  - This file: explicit listing of fork changes and commit history.
  - [.agent/workflows/update_clawdbot.md](.agent/workflows/update_clawdbot.md): push policy and link to this file.
- **Maintenance runbook**
  - [docs/MAINTENANCE.md](docs/MAINTENANCE.md): fork update workflow, stop-before-rebuild, avoiding `openclaw doctor`/`gateway install` overwrites, health-check script for VPS/repo installs, and **Why skills.json can disappear** (agent running `git clean -fd` in repo workspace; restore via `pnpm build`; gateway fallback loads from source when dist copy is missing).

### Prompt-engine, skills loader, and build pipeline

- **Skills data packaging**
  - Copy `src/agents/prompt-engine/data/skills.json` and `src/agents/prompt-engine/data/domain-map.json` to `dist/data/` and `dist/agents/prompt-engine/data/` during build via `scripts/copy-skills-data.ts` (tsdown does not copy non-TS assets; without this, the Skills Registry and domain map hit ENOENT at runtime). When the gateway runs as `node dist/index.js`, the loader resolves `dist/data/skills.json` and `dist/data/domain-map.json` first so it works with the bundled layout.
- **Build race (skills ENOENT) hardening**
  - Avoid empty-`dist/` window during `pnpm build`: (1) `tsdown.config.ts` sets `clean: false` so the output dir is not wiped and `dist/data/` persists; (2) gateway eager-loads `SkillsLoader.loadLibrary()` at boot and caches in RAM so cron/agent turns never read disk during a build; (3) loader retries on ENOENT for a short window. See [MAINTENANCE.md](docs/MAINTENANCE.md) “Build-phase race”.
- **Skills loader resolution**
  - Resolves `skills.json` in order: `dist/data/skills.json` (when `argv[1]` is `.../dist/index.js`), then same-dir `data/skills.json`, then `src/agents/prompt-engine/data/skills.json`. If the dist copy is missing, logs `Loaded skills from source path (dist copy missing)` and may retry; gateway boot preloads the library into a static singleton so the running process does not depend on disk after startup. `domain-map.json` uses the same path order (dist/data, then source); if missing, loader returns `{ domains: {} }` and the triangulator still has a General fallback.
- **Type/SDK fixes**
  - `SkillDefinition` includes optional `associated_domains` for parity with ClawdBot-Next. Skill selection in the system prompt uses `SkillsLoader.getSkillsForDomain(context.domain)` (domain-map–driven); no in-repo `selectSkillsForContext`; `skills.json` and `domain-map.json` are copied to dist during build.

### Gateway tools and execution controls

- **Gateway tools: stderr piping**
  - Exec/process tools now surface **truncated stderr** in tool results for better self-correction:
    - `exec` synchronous failures attach a `stderr` field on the tool error (last 50 lines, max ~2KB), which is then exposed in the JSON tool result returned to the model.
    - Background exec sessions tracked via the `process` tool include a truncated `stderr` tail in `details` for `list`, `poll`, and `log` actions when available.
  - Implementation lives in `src/agents/bash-tools.exec.ts`, `src/agents/bash-tools.process.ts`, `src/agents/bash-process-registry.ts`, and the generic adapter `src/agents/pi-tool-definition-adapter.ts`.
  - Tests: `src/agents/pi-tool-definition-adapter.test.ts`, `src/agents/bash-tools.exec.background-abort.test.ts`, and `src/agents/bash-tools.process.send-keys.test.ts` cover stderr truncation and wiring.
- **Tool-level concurrency locks (singleton tools)**
  - Plugin tools (skills) that shell out to host CLIs can be marked as **singletons** via the `OPENCLAW_SINGLETON_TOOLS` env var (comma-separated, normalized names). When enabled for a tool name, the gateway wraps that plugin tool’s `execute` in a per-name semaphore so only one invocation per tool runs at a time; concurrent calls are queued instead of failing with transient CLI errors (for example `"Command exited with code 1"` when multiple agents hit a Twitter/email CLI simultaneously). Configuration is operational-only; no code changes are required to add/remove singleton tools. See [docs/MAINTENANCE.md](docs/MAINTENANCE.md) “Tool-level concurrency locks for CLI-backed skills”.
- **Agent loop guardrails**
  - One config/restart/cron change per request; report and ask before retry (`394341893`).
- **Native compaction command**
  - **CLI:** `openclaw memory compact --agent <id>` runs compaction on the latest session transcript for that agent (optional `--instructions <string>`, `--force` reserved). Uses the same core as `/compact` (summarize + prune); session is loaded from disk and workspace/model come from config and cwd. See [CLI memory](https://docs.openclaw.ai/cli/memory).
  - **Proactive auto-compaction:** In the embedded Pi run loop, if estimated session tokens ≥ 80% of the model context window before the next turn, OpenClaw compacts once and then proceeds, reducing context-overflow errors. If compaction reports "Already compacted" (or does not reduce the session), the loop proceeds to the turn instead of retrying indefinitely.
  - **/compact scope:** `/compact` is registered with `scope: "both"` and `nativeName: "compact"` so channels that support native UI (e.g. Telegram) can show a compact button as well as the slash command.

### Docker image, health checks, and helper shims

- **Container helper binaries (baked into Docker image)**
  - New `bin/` directory with:
    - `bin/docker-health`: safe health check for all containers that:
      - exits `127` if `docker` is not installed
      - handles the "no containers" case cleanly
      - prints `<container-name>: <status>` using `.State.Health.Status` when present, falling back to `.State.Status`
    - `bin/weather`: small weather wrapper for the gateway agent that:
      - uses `flock` on `/tmp/weather-tool.lock` to avoid thundering herd (multiple concurrent weather tool calls)
      - prefers `wttr.in` with a 2s timeout and falls back to Open-Meteo for Jefferson, GA (Phil’s node) when needed
    - `bin/himalaya`: Himalaya CLI v1.1.0 compatibility shim that:
      - resolves the real binary as `himalaya-real` when available (or `/usr/local/bin/himalaya` otherwise)
      - remaps `list` → `envelope list`, `read` → `message read`, and `envelope read` → `message read` while passing other commands through
  - Root `Dockerfile` copies `bin/` into `/usr/local/bin/` and marks the helper scripts executable so they are always available in containerized deployments (Fly, Render, GCP, etc.).

### Scheduler and cron reliability

- **Cron zombie scheduler + in-flight job persistence**
  - Hardening to prevent and recover from a stuck scheduler **without losing one-shot reminders**:
    - Re-arm timer in catch block when `onTimer` throws.
    - Re-arm on `cron list` / `cron status` when timer is dead (zombie recovery).
    - Watchdog timer (every 2.5 min) re-arms if main timer dies.
    - **Anti-zombie self-healing**: secondary check-in every 60s; if no timer tick completes within 60s (e.g. event loop blocked), the scheduler re-initializes (clear timer, re-arm) so the service does not stay "Active" with jobs frozen. Unit tests in `src/cron/service.anti-zombie.test.ts` cover re-init when idle and no false positive when a recent tick completed.
    - Per-job dynamic stuck threshold (`runningAtMs`) based on job timeout.
    - Stale `state.running` recovery when `onTimer` hangs.
    - **In-flight job persistence**: anti-zombie recovery scans for stale `runningAtMs` markers, clears them, and marks those jobs due again so mid-flight one-shot `--at` reminders are retried instead of silently dropped. Startup only clears obviously stale `runningAtMs` markers to avoid double-running fresh in-flight work.
    - Troubleshooting docs for "Cron stuck (zombie scheduler)" updated to describe anti-zombie recovery logs and in-flight job persistence.

### Plugin CLI command registration

- **Dynamic subcommand linkage**
  - Plugin-provided CLI commands (e.g. `openclaw foundry-openclaw`) were failing with "unknown command" despite the plugin being loaded. Plugin CLI registration runs in `run-main` before lazy subcli registration and before parse: `registerPluginCliCommands(program, loadConfig())` is invoked so plugin subcommands are on the root program in time. Built-in commands (e.g. `memory`) are registered during `buildProgram()`, so overlapping plugin commands are skipped and no duplicate-command error occurs. No manual binary edits are required; `openclaw <plugin-cmd>` works when the plugin is enabled and registers a CLI. See `src/cli/run-main.ts`, `src/plugins/cli.ts`, and tests in `src/plugins/cli.test.ts`, `src/cli/program/command-registry.test.ts`.

### Plugin API handler registration leak

- **Typed hooks accumulation on reload**
  - The Plugin API supports typed hooks (e.g. `before_tool_call`, `tool_result_persist`). On gateway restart, plugin reload, or hot-reload, new handlers were registered without clearing the previous registry’s typed hooks, so the count grew (e.g. 300+ handlers). Fix: the loader now clears the previous registry’s typed hooks before creating a new one. In `src/plugins/registry.ts`, `clearTypedHooks()` and `clearTypedHooksForPlugin(pluginId)` were added and returned from `createPluginRegistry()`. In `src/plugins/loader.ts`, the loader stores the current registry’s `clearTypedHooks` and invokes it at the start of the next full load (after `clearPluginCommands()`), so the registry being replaced is cleared before a fresh one is built and passed to the global hook runner.

### Model / provider integrations

- **Ollama**
  - Support `OLLAMA_HOST` for cloud/remote discovery and requests (`8cb58d65d`). When `OLLAMA_HOST` is set, discovery uses a 15s timeout (vs 5s for local) to reduce timeouts on VPS/remote.
  - After merging upstream (openclaw#14131), both behaviors are preserved: (1) **Configured base URL** — when an explicit `baseUrl` is provided (e.g. via config or `explicitProviders.ollama.baseUrl`), it is used for discovery and the provider; (2) **OLLAMA_HOST fallback** — when no base URL is configured, `OLLAMA_HOST` (or the default localhost) is used. `resolveOllamaApiBase(configuredBaseUrl?)` and `buildOllamaProvider(configuredBaseUrl?)` in `src/agents/models-config.providers.ts` implement this; tests cover both “OLLAMA_HOST for provider baseUrl” and “preserve explicit ollama baseUrl on implicit provider injection”.
  - **Per-agent models.json safety** — `update.run` now clears `~/.openclaw/agents/*/agent/models.json` after successful updates so any hallucinated or stale model registries are discarded and regenerated from the canonical config on next boot.

### Foundry / Cursor integration hardening

- **Tool group tightening for agents**
  - `group:fs` now expands to `read` + `apply_patch` only. Direct `write`/`edit` are no longer part of the global fs group and must be granted explicitly on a per-agent basis (for example, to a dedicated analyst workspace) instead of every agent inheriting broad write access.
  - Gateway docs and examples have been updated so `tools.profile: "coding"` plus `group:fs` describe read + structured patch access, matching the new behavior.
- **Config template guidance**
  - The default `openclaw.json` example under `docs/gateway/configuration-examples.md` now recommends granting global `exec`/`process` + `group:fs` only, with a comment pointing operators toward per-agent tool grants for high-privilege writers.
  - `.env.example` documents `GATEWAY_BOOTSTRAP_TIMEOUT=120000` as the recommended baseline when running heavy Foundry-style plugin stacks so cold-start SIGKILLs are less likely.
- **Foundry-side config writes (external repo)**
  - When updating the OpenClaw-Foundry extension, ensure its `foundry_write_extension` (or equivalent) performs a pre-flight check before committing any `models.providers` or provider entries into `openclaw.json`: for each new provider, verify the corresponding API key/token environment variables are present, and abort with a clear error if they are not. This keeps the gateway from booting into an invalid provider config.

### Discord typing and message hooks

- **Typing on message receive** — The Discord monitor now sends a typing indicator as soon as a non-empty message is accepted for processing (in addition to the existing typing on reply start). Implemented in `src/discord/monitor/message-handler.process.ts` via `sendTyping({ client, channelId: message.channelId })` right after the empty-text check.
- **Internal hook events `message:received` and `message:sent`** — New event type `"message"` added to the internal hook system (`src/hooks/internal-hooks.ts`) with:
  - **`message:received`**: fired at the start of Discord message processing with context `channel`, `senderId`, `channelId`, `messageText`.
  - **`message:sent`**: fired after each Discord reply is delivered with context `channel`, `sessionId`, `replyText`.
  - Handlers can register for `"message"`, `"message:received"`, or `"message:sent"` as with other hook types. Telegram can be wired similarly in `src/telegram/bot-message-dispatch.ts` and delivery if needed.

### Upstream merge (Feb 2026) and session path fix

- **Merge from openclaw/main** — Integrated 113 upstream commits (through early Feb 2026). Resolved 9 conflicts while keeping fork behavior: labeler uses `github.token` (no App) in label/label-issues jobs; stderr in tool errors + `after_tool_call` on errors in `pi-tool-definition-adapter.ts`; upstream safe skill sync dest + fork `baseDir` check in `skills/workspace.ts`; async `buildAgentSystemPrompt` tests in `system-prompt.test.ts`; fork `getLatestSessionTranscriptForAgent` plus upstream path validation/APIs in `config/sessions/paths.ts`; both proactive-compaction and upstream promptTokens test in `run.overflow-compaction.test.ts`; `/compact` `scope: "both"` in `commands-registry.data.ts`. Discord channel-fetch test expectation updated for upstream role-based routing.
- **Session file path resolution** — Upstream added strict validation in `resolvePathWithinSessionsDir` (“Session file path must be within sessions directory”). When the reply flow called `resolveSessionFilePath` without `agentId`, the default agent’s sessions dir was used; sessions for other agents (e.g. Discord `analyst`) could have stored absolute `sessionFile` paths, causing the check to throw. Fix: (1) pass `{ agentId }` from `runPreparedReply` into `resolveSessionFilePath` in `src/auto-reply/reply/get-reply-run.ts` so the sessions dir matches the session’s agent; (2) in `resolveSessionFilePath`, if the stored `sessionFile` would escape the sessions dir (legacy absolute path or wrong agent), fall back to the path derived from `sessionId` under the same dir instead of throwing.

- _(Add further customizations, fixes, or config here as you make them.)_

## Workflow / tooling

- **Sync workflow** — [.agent/workflows/update_clawdbot.md](.agent/workflows/update_clawdbot.md): steps for rebasing/merging from upstream (ClawdBot-Next and OpenClaw), conflict patterns, prompt-engine merge notes, rebuild and verify steps.
- Push policy: only to this fork; never push to ClawdBot-Next or OpenClaw upstream.

## Commit history (fork-only)

Commits on this fork’s `main` that are not in upstream OpenClaw (oldest first). Regenerate with: `git log upstream/main..origin/main --oneline --no-merges`. After the Feb 2026 upstream merge, fork-only commits include the merge resolution and the session path fix (pass `agentId` into `resolveSessionFilePath`, defensive fallback when stored path escapes sessions dir).
