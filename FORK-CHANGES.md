# Fork-specific changes

Explicit listing of changes in this fork relative to upstream [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw). For sync procedure, see [.agent/workflows/update_clawdbot.md](.agent/workflows/update_clawdbot.md).

## ClawdBot-Next / prompt-engine integration

- **Agent system prompt** — Integrated [ClawdBot-Next](https://github.com/ClawdBot/ClawdBot-Next) prompt-engine:
  - `src/agents/prompt-engine/`: skills loader, triangulator, skill injector, system directives, types, clawd-matrix, data/skills.json.
  - `src/agents/system-prompt.ts`: uses `SkillsLoader`, `Triangulator`, `SkillInjector`, `SYSTEM_DIRECTIVES`; `buildAgentSystemPrompt` is async and accepts optional `userPrompt` for triangulation. OpenClaw-specific sections (safety, branding, `memoryCitationsMode`, sandbox) preserved.
  - `src/agents/pi-embedded-runner/system-prompt.ts`: passes `userPrompt` through to `buildAgentSystemPrompt` and awaits it.
- Kept in sync with upstream ClawdBot-Next where applicable; OpenClaw naming and config preserved where we diverge.

## Maintainer-specific changes

### Documentation and maintenance

- **Docs + metadata**
  - Root [README.md](README.md): “About this repository” section describing the fork, ClawdBot-Next integration, [docs/MAINTENANCE.md](docs/MAINTENANCE.md) link, and sync workflow link.
  - This file: explicit listing of fork changes and commit history.
  - [.agent/workflows/update_clawdbot.md](.agent/workflows/update_clawdbot.md): push policy and link to this file.
- **Maintenance runbook**
  - [docs/MAINTENANCE.md](docs/MAINTENANCE.md): fork update workflow, stop-before-rebuild, avoiding `openclaw doctor`/`gateway install` overwrites, health-check script for VPS/repo installs, and **Why skills.json can disappear** (agent running `git clean -fd` in repo workspace; restore via `pnpm build`; gateway fallback loads from source when dist copy is missing).

### Prompt-engine, skills loader, and build pipeline

- **Skills data packaging**
  - Copy `src/agents/prompt-engine/data/skills.json` to `dist/data/` and `dist/agents/prompt-engine/data/` during build via `scripts/copy-skills-data.ts` (tsdown does not copy non-TS assets; without this, the Skills Registry hits ENOENT at runtime). When the gateway runs as `node dist/index.js`, the loader resolves `dist/data/skills.json` first so it works with the bundled layout.
- **Build race (skills ENOENT) hardening**
  - Avoid empty-`dist/` window during `pnpm build`: (1) `tsdown.config.ts` sets `clean: false` so the output dir is not wiped and `dist/data/` persists; (2) gateway eager-loads `SkillsLoader.loadLibrary()` at boot and caches in RAM so cron/agent turns never read disk during a build; (3) loader retries on ENOENT for a short window. See [MAINTENANCE.md](docs/MAINTENANCE.md) “Build-phase race”.
- **Skills loader resolution**
  - Resolves `skills.json` in order: `dist/data/skills.json` (when `argv[1]` is `.../dist/index.js`), then same-dir `data/skills.json`, then `src/agents/prompt-engine/data/skills.json`. If the dist copy is missing, logs `Loaded skills from source path (dist copy missing)` and may retry; gateway boot preloads the library into a static singleton so the running process does not depend on disk after startup.
- **Type/SDK fixes**
  - Type fix for `SkillLibrary` in `selectSkillsForContext` (plugin-sdk dts build) and ensured `skills.json` is copied to dist during build.

### Gateway tools and execution controls

- **Gateway tools: stderr piping**
  - Exec/process tools now surface **truncated stderr** in tool results for better self-correction:
    - `exec` synchronous failures attach a `stderr` field on the tool error (last 50 lines, max ~2KB), which is then exposed in the JSON tool result returned to the model.
    - Background exec sessions tracked via the `process` tool include a truncated `stderr` tail in `details` for `list`, `poll`, and `log` actions when available.
  - Implementation lives in `src/agents/bash-tools.exec.ts`, `src/agents/bash-tools.process.ts`, `src/agents/bash-process-registry.ts`, and the generic adapter `src/agents/pi-tool-definition-adapter.ts`.
  - Tests: `src/agents/pi-tool-definition-adapter.test.ts`, `src/agents/bash-tools.exec.background-abort.test.ts`, and `src/agents/bash-tools.process.send-keys.test.ts` cover stderr truncation and wiring.
- **Tool-level concurrency locks (singleton tools)**
  - Plugin tools (skills) that shell out to host CLIs can be marked as **singletons** via the `OPENCLAW_SINGLETON_TOOLS` env var (comma-separated, normalized names). When enabled for a tool name, the gateway wraps that plugin tool’s `execute` in a per-name semaphore so only one invocation per tool runs at a time; concurrent calls are queued instead of failing with transient CLI errors (for example `"Command exited with code 1"` when multiple agents hit a Twitter/email CLI simultaneously). Configuration is operational-only; no code changes are required to add/remove singleton tools. See [docs/MAINTENANCE.md](docs/MAINTENANCE.md) “Tool-level concurrency locks for CLI-backed skills”.
- **Agent loop guardrails**
  - One config/restart/cron change per request; report and ask before retry (`394341893`).

### Scheduler and cron reliability

- **Cron zombie scheduler + in-flight job persistence**
  - Hardening to prevent and recover from a stuck scheduler **without losing one-shot reminders**:
    - Re-arm timer in catch block when `onTimer` throws.
    - Re-arm on `cron list` / `cron status` when timer is dead (zombie recovery).
    - Watchdog timer (every 2.5 min) re-arms if main timer dies.
    - **Anti-zombie self-healing**: secondary check-in every 60s; if no timer tick completes within 60s (e.g. event loop blocked), the scheduler re-initializes (clear timer, re-arm) so the service does not stay "Active" with jobs frozen. Unit tests in `src/cron/service.anti-zombie.test.ts` cover re-init when idle and no false positive when a recent tick completed.
    - Per-job dynamic stuck threshold (`runningAtMs`) based on job timeout.
    - Stale `state.running` recovery when `onTimer` hangs.
    - **In-flight job persistence**: anti-zombie recovery scans for stale `runningAtMs` markers, clears them, and marks those jobs due again so mid-flight one-shot `--at` reminders are retried instead of silently dropped. Startup only clears obviously stale `runningAtMs` markers to avoid double-running fresh in-flight work.
    - Troubleshooting docs for "Cron stuck (zombie scheduler)" updated to describe anti-zombie recovery logs and in-flight job persistence.

### Plugin CLI command registration

- **Dynamic subcommand linkage**
  - Plugin-provided CLI commands (e.g. `openclaw foundry-openclaw`) were failing with "unknown command" despite the plugin being loaded. Plugin CLI registration runs in `run-main` before lazy subcli registration and before parse: `registerPluginCliCommands(program, loadConfig())` is invoked so plugin subcommands are on the root program in time. Built-in commands (e.g. `memory`) are registered during `buildProgram()`, so overlapping plugin commands are skipped and no duplicate-command error occurs. No manual binary edits are required; `openclaw <plugin-cmd>` works when the plugin is enabled and registers a CLI. See `src/cli/run-main.ts`, `src/plugins/cli.ts`, and tests in `src/plugins/cli.test.ts`, `src/cli/program/command-registry.test.ts`.

### WebSocket recovery persistence

- **Discord and gateway transient disconnect handling** — Keeps session handles alive during brief WebSocket disconnects (e.g. 1006):
  - **Retention**: On disconnect, sessions are marked zombie instead of purged; a 30s reaper cleans up if no reconnection.
  - **Re-binding**: When a new connection arrives for the same agent:channel:recipient triplet within the window, the reaper is halted and the new WebSocket is bound to the existing session.
  - **Outbound queuing**: Discord reply delivery queues results during recovery instead of dropping them; queued replies flush on reconnect.
  - Key files: `src/gateway/zombie-session-buffer.ts`, `src/discord/recovery-state.ts`, `src/discord/monitor.gateway.ts`, `src/discord/monitor/reply-delivery.ts`, `src/gateway/server/ws-connection.ts`.
  - See [Discord channel docs](docs/channels/discord.md) for troubleshooting transient disconnects.

### Model / provider integrations

- **Ollama**
  - Support `OLLAMA_HOST` for cloud/remote discovery and requests (`8cb58d65d`). When `OLLAMA_HOST` is set, discovery uses a 15s timeout (vs 5s for local) to reduce timeouts on VPS/remote.

- _(Add further customizations, fixes, or config here as you make them.)_

## Workflow / tooling

- **Sync workflow** — [.agent/workflows/update_clawdbot.md](.agent/workflows/update_clawdbot.md): steps for rebasing/merging from upstream (ClawdBot-Next and OpenClaw), conflict patterns, prompt-engine merge notes, rebuild and verify steps.
- Push policy: only to this fork; never push to ClawdBot-Next or OpenClaw upstream.
